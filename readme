In This Release
===============
This file describes the Lanner bypass/watchdog module acces code.  
This package provides program and driver for both DOS and Linux.
Separated makefile available as well.(Makefile.dos or Makefile.linux)

For DOS environment, Use DJGPP as compiler, use DJGPP and Makefile.dos.

For Linux, supports kernel versions 2.4.x/2.6/3.x/4.x and use Makefile.linux. 


This release provide 3 ways to access Lanner bypass/watchdog module: 

1. DIRECT_IO_ACCESS:

   To access Lanner bypass/watchdog module by userland application direct
   accessing. This mode JUST FOR providing quick way for user to realize 
   Lannner watchdog/bypass function. This mode supported on DOS and Linux.

   Note: This mode is enabled by set DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=1 in Makefile.


2. LANNER_DRIVER:

   To access Lanner bypass/watchdog module through lanner driver. 
   Lanner driver(bpwd_drv.ko) is available in bin sub-directory after make.
   This driver is only supported as a loadable module at this time.  Lanner is
   not supplying patches against the kernel source to allow for static linking
   of the driver. 

   Note: This mode is enabled by set DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=0 and LANNER_DRIVER=1 in 
   Makefile.


3. LINUX_KERNEL_DRIVER:

   To access Lanner bypass/watchdog module through linux i2c dev interface. 
   i2c-dev.ko and i2c-i801.ko are need to be loader for normal access.
   /dev/i2c-0 c 89 0 node is need to be created as well.

   Note1: This mode is enabled by set DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=0 and LANNER_DRIVER=0 in 
          Makefile.
   Note2: Linux kernel driver(i2c-i801.c) is lacked for block accessing. 
          Varied kernel version may get different results. 
          For example, 2.6.18(CentOS-54) do not support SMBUS block function.
	  2.6.25(FC9) block write function fail. 
          Since Lanner bypass/watchdog ARP function relied on BLOCK+PEC 
          accessing, this cause ARP function fail.
   Note3: MB-5330 is using AMD Structure system, and we only support 
          DIRECT_IO_ACCESS and LANNER_DRIVER in source code.
          


Building
========
To build, 4 steps to completed:

1. Identify current OS and select proper Makefile. 
   Copy Makefile.(os) to Makefile.

2. Select access mode.(DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=[0|1] and LANNER_DRIVER=[0|1] by 
   edit Makefile)

4. Select Major number assign mode. (MAJOR_NUMBER=[0|xxx] by edit Makefile)

	 Note: 1. MAJOR_NUMBER define only usefule in LANNER_DRIVER=1
         2. Set MAJOR_NUMBER=0, then use Dynamic major number assign
	       

3. Just type make to build, once completed, bin sub-directory contains.



Installation
============
To installation, depend on what's access mode you set:

If DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=1, no driver is need. Just execute bpwd_tst program to
to access Lanner bypass/watchdog module.

If DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=0 and LANNER_DRIVER=1, driver is needed. Insert module and
create node in /dev as below example:

	#insmod bpwd_drv.[k]o

	#mknod /dev/bpwd_drv c 247 0

  Note: '247' in here is for example, if '247' is already occupied,
           please check other major number of kernel driver populated. 
           or modify Makefile's "MAJOR_NUMBER" to "0" use Dynamic number,
           then chenag it as dynamic assigned unmber.

If DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=0 and LANNER_DRIVER=0, linux kernel driver is needed. 
i2c subsystem: i2c-core, i2c-dev and busses/i2c-i801 need to be loaded before
access Lanner bypass/watchdog module, dev node need to create as below:

	#mknod /dev/i2c-0 c 89 0
	 
	Note: '0' in here is for example, check proper bus number of kernel driver 
              populated. 
              

HOW-TO ACCESS
=============
Once build completed, application(and driver) is available in bin sub-directory.
Main access program is bpwd_tst. just run it without argument will list help.

For multiple card configuration
-------------------------------
  Since multiple bypass add-on card maybe populate on motherboard, isolate bypass 
card by I2C switch is implemented in following motherboard:

	model_name	simple_model_name	Lanner model 
	=====================================================
	MB-887X		Mode1			  MB-8875, MB-8876, MB-8865, MB-8866, 
	                      MB-8877, MB-8771,NCB-5210
	MB-8877EXT	Mode2			MB-8877(with RC-8877 expansion card, 4 slots)							
	MB-8865EXT	Mode3			MB-8865(with RC-8865 expansion card, 6 slots)						
	MB-7582EXT	Mode4			MB-7582(with RC-7582 expansion card, 6 slots)								
	MB-7583		  Mode5			MB-7583, MB-7573								
	MB-8771EXT	Mode6			MB-8771(with RC-8771 expansion card, 2 slots)
  MB-8895		  Mode7			MB-8896, MB-8895, MB-8893, NCB-5510A
	MB-MFI20K	  Mode8			MB-MFI20K(with RC-MFI20K expansion card, 9 slots)  	
  MB-9655		  Mode9			MB-9655
	NCB-5510EXT	Mode10		NCB-5510(with RC-88771 expansion card, 8 slots)
	NCB-5220	  Mode11		NCB-5220
	NCB-2510	  Mode12		NCB-2510
	NCB-6210	  Mode13		NCB-6210
 
Program need to specific with -M [model_name] or -M [simple_model_name]
for dedicate motherboard and device address [specific by -d]
 is fixed as below:
	0x30: slot1
	0x31: slot2
	0x32: slot3
	0x33: slot4
	0x34: slot5
	0x35: slot6
	0x36: slot7
  0x37: slot8
  0x38: slot9

If bypass controller is add-on card, below using i2c address 0x30 at first slot on the motherboard. 
Following is example within -M command:

  MB-8875 as example, access slot1( address is :0x30)
    Write:
	bpwd_tst -w -d 0x30 -c 0x12 -o 0x03 -M MB-887X 
		Or
	bpwd_tst -w -d 0x30 -c 0x12 -o 0x03 -M Mode1
	
    Read:
	bpwd_tst -r -d 0x30 -c 0x12 -M MB-887X  
		Or
	bpwd_tst -r -d 0x30 -c 0x12 -M Mode1
	
     Scan Bus:
	bpwd_tst -S -M MB-887X
		Or
	bpwd_tst -S -M Mode1
	
For on-board configuration
--------------------------
If bypass controller is embedded in motherboard, no -M parameter is needed and i2c address is fixed to 0x37.
Following is example without -M command:

     MB-8765 as exampple
     Write
	bpwd_tst -w -d 0x37 -c 0x12 -o 0x03
     Read:
	bpwd_tst -r -d 0x37 -c 0x12
     Scan Bus:
	bpwd_tst -S

Example sub-directory presented you how to access module. 
You may add -M parameter for proper motherboard.



Support model
=============
Following is the list of Lanner's model which support 3rd bypass.

3rd bypass add-on card, which connect to motherboard with i2c switch to control each device.
You should have to use -M command to control each slot.
